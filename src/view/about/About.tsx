Computers was introduced to me at a very young age and with the curiosity of a child, which has stuck to me to this day, Iâ€™ve managed to accumulate major knowledge in the fields within.

Today I primarily create websites using modern JavaScript frameworks React & Angular, but I am also comfortable working with server technology & databases such as Node.js, Java & NoSQL & SQL.
In later years I have also received formal education as I studied computer science at the university to help me widen and deepen my knowledge.

My craft is precise and i take great pleasure in what i do.
